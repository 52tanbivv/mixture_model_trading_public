Resolution: Daily

> Get 252 day history of asset
- estimate the optimal number of components using bic
    - fit gmm using components
    - extract hidden states, parameters
    - sample from distr using those parameters
> Log confidence interval boundaries for each symbol
> Compare boundaries with current return to identify outliers
> assess direction of outliers e.g. too low or too high
> if trade is triggered use market on open order
> store order time, quantity filled, quantity
    - compare quantity w/ quantity filled to confirm full order
    - what to do with partial orders?
    - if order filled store order Id? and timestamp
> to exit trade compare trade fill date with current date
    - if time delta == lookahead period liquidate
    
> Should every trade be taken? Trade size?
    - thinking yes and 2-5% of portfolio equity.
