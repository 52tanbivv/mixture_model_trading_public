This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

Tutorial demonstrating trading algorithm development from theory to implementation.

Focuses on using mixture models as a method for market timing.Types of mixtures covered include:

* gaussian mixtures (sklearn, pymc3)
* bayesian mixtures (sklearn, pymc3)
* nonparametric mixtures (sklearn, pymc3)
* gaussian processes (sklearn, pymc3)
 
### Chapter (Notebook) Outlines ###

1. Motivation
	- this chapter goes through a demo of challenges to time series prediction using real market data
	- what is stationarity?
	- why one distribution isn't enough?
	- how can multiple distributions help?
2. Gaussian mixtures
	- in this chapter we explore the underlying intuition behind gaussian mixtures
	- we apply a gaussian mixture model to predict security return distribution
	- example in sklearn
	- demo strengths and weaknesses
3. Nonparametric mixture models
	1. bayesian mixtures using sklearn and pymc3
		- demo strengths and weaknesses
	2. dirichlet mixtures
		- demo strengths and weaknesses
	3. gaussian processes using sklearn and pymc3
		- demo strengths and weaknesses
4. Designing the strategy
	1. hypothesis/theory
	2. testing
5. Operationalizing 
	1. ??
